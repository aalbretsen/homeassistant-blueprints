    Blueprint for motion sensor controlled light.
    <br /> - Restarts timer each time motion is detected.
    <br /> - (Re)starts timer if light is manually turned on (or turned on by other source).
    <br /> - Resets when light is manually turned off (or turned off by other source).
    <br /> - Support for blocking value (block at night).
